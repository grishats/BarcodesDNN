This repository will contain the implementation of ideas which were highlighted in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03139

TODO:
1. Stable path between 2 local minimas search and saddle point estimation
2. Interpreting loss functions Barcode depending on a particular Neural Network's architecture
